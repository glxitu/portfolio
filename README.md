Mathematical models and simulation setups

In this folder you can find several simulation setups developed in Matlab to evaluate some of the proposed MAC schemes for Cognitive Radio networks. You can also find some mathematical models, implemented using the Mathematica software, used to characterize the performance of the proposed protocols.
